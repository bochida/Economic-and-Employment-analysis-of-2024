📌 Kazakhstan Labor Market Analysis (Q4 2024)
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Kazakhstan’s labor market using data from the 4th quarter of 2024. Leveraging tools like Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Power BI, we examine employment trends, unemployment dynamics, wage disparities, and regional labor variations. The insights aim to highlight key socio-economic patterns influencing the labor force in Kazakhstan.
